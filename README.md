# Kalman-Filter
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a 1D Kalman Filter for tracking an object's position over time, smoothing out the noise from measurements to produce an accurate state estimation. This example is ideal for understanding the basics of Kalman Filtering, especially for beginners in tracking or state estimation.

Overview::
The Kalman Filter is a mathematical algorithm that provides an optimal estimate of a system's state (like position and velocity)

Files in This Repository::
kalmanFil.m: The main MATLAB script implementing the 1D Kalman Filter.
README.md: Documentation on usage, installation, and background information.

Usage::

Clone the Repository

Run the Script: Open kalmanFil.m in MATLAB and run the script to see the Kalman Filter in action. You can adjust parameters like noise levels to observe different filter behaviors.

Example Output::

After running the code, youâ€™ll see plots showing:

The predicted and measured positions over time.
The estimation error as the Kalman Filter smooths out measurement noise.
